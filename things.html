                <p>
                    It's a great chance to travel back in time and experience Kuala Lumpur
                    in the early 20th century by going to the Kampung Baru neighbourhood.
                    In reality, Kampung Baru is a traditional Malaysian neighbourhood that
                    was built more than a century ago. Even though they are located in the
                    middle of the city and surrounded by gleaming skyscrapers, many of the
                    homes are wooden houses that are sitting on short stilts. The 
                    neighbourhood has a strong rural village vibe. <br><br>
                    Here are some of the place that worth a visit:<br>
                </p><br><br>

                <img src="image/history place.webp" width="100%">
                <h3> Master Mat's House </h3>
                <p>
                    This wooden home, built by a well-known former headmaster, stands out 
                    for its vivid blue colour, stone pillars, and curved staircase. 
                    The Master Mat family still resides here, and it is the third generation.

                <img src="image/history place2.webp" width="100%">
                <h3> Kelab Sultan Suleiman Gallery </h3>
                <p> This historic structure shows Malaysia's history from its earliest days
                     through the colonial era.  Its design is based on the Suleiman Social 
                     Club's second renovation.

                <img src="image/history place3.webp" width="100%">
                <h3> Masjid Jamek Kampung Bharu </h3>
                <p> For more than a century, the neighborhood's Muslims prayed in this 
                    beautifully elegant mosque. For the daily breaking of the fast and 
                    other charitable events throughout the fasting month of Ramadan, 
                    the mosque serves as the main gathering place.

                <h3> Rumah Limas </h3>
                <p> Originally constructed in 1931 and post-war rebuilt in 1949, this is
                    a traditional Malay home. It would have been one of the larger homes 
                    of the era, but today, the vast urban development taking position all 
                    around it has made it insignificant.

            <p> Visitors to Kampung Baru have the chance to try a variety of yummy meals
                 in addition to seeing the town's historical sites. <br><br>
                 Following are a few
                 locations in Kampung Baru that are worthwhile visiting:<br><br>

            <img src="image/food1.jpeg" width="45%">
            <h3> Nasi Lemak Wanjo </h3>
            <p> This restaurant has been in business for more than 50 years and was 
                previously known as nasi lemak mak wanjo. Yet, because it is open until 
                late at night, locals continue to come here for meals and supper. 
            </p><br><br>

            <img src="image/food hunting2.webp" width="100%">
            <h3> Malay Food Streets (Jalan Raja Muda Musa) </h3>
            <p> As Malay food stalls prepare their goods in the evening, this area releases
                mouthwatering aromas. The food is tasty and affordable here. Local favourites 
                include tapai, a sweet fermented rice dessert frequently wrapped in banana 
                leaves, nasi ayam goreng (fried chicken rice), nasi lemak antarabangsa 
                (international nasi lemak), and chicken skewers drenched in peanut sauce with 
                crispy shallots.

            <h3> Warung Pak Hassan Kampung Baru </h3>
            <p> Another well-known restaurant in Kampung Baru for its different roti canai 
                served with chicken feet is Warung Pak Hassan. One of Kampung Baru's top roti 
                canai restaurants is Warung Pak Hassan. Customers must wait in queue for a while 
                at the shop because there is always a long queue. The restaurant is a self-service 
                establishment, so you queue, choose what you desire and pay for it at the checkout counter.

            <h3> Cendol Durian Kampung Baru </h3>
            <p> Cendol Durian Kampung Baru is a well-known cendol that is located in Jalan 
                Raja Alang. Big chunks of durian flesh are included with the cendol, which 
                is also incredibly inexpensive. Any fan of cendol and durian should at least 
                once try this experience.
