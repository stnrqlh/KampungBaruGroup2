                <p>Kampung Bharu  is a distinctive and historic district situated in the centre of Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. It stands in stark contrast to the contemporary high-rise structures and bustling urban scene that surround it since it is one of the last traditional Malay villages still in existence in the city.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The history of Kampung Bharu dates back to the late 1800s. In order to preserve the Malay population's cultural identity and customs in the face of growing urbanisation, the British colonial authorities gave the Malay community land in 1899. Originally, the region was supposed to serve as a buffer between the traditional Malay way of life and the British colonial government.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The traditional Malay architecture of Kampung Bharu is one of its most distinguishing characteristics. The majority of the homes in the village are built with wooden beams, stilts, and pitched roofs. While modernization has resulted in certain changes, efforts have been made to maintain the architecture's traditional appeal.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the Malay population in Kuala Lumpur, the village continues to be a crucial cultural and historical place. It has evolved into a representation of Malay identity, traditions, and rituals over time. Visitors to Kampung Bharu get the chance to immerse themselves in Malay culture, enjoy local cuisine, and take in a variety of cultural activities.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Even though it is a traditional village, Kampung Bharu is ideally situated in the centre of Kuala Lumpur, making it a desirable location for real estate. There have been conversations and disagreements throughout the years regarding how to modernise the neighbourhood while retaining its identity and cultural heritage. Given the historical importance and sentimental worth associated with the village, striking a balance between development and preservation has been difficult.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Kampung Bharu has drawn tourists looking to experience the traditional Malay way of life within a modern metropolis as the city has grown and expanded. Homestays, cultural excursions, and handicrafts have become well-liked tourist attractions in the area, contributing to its economic growth.</p>
